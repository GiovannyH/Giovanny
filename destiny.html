	<p> At the moment, Desting is my go-to game. I do jump from game to game and change it up. Other games I play are Minecraft, Zombie Army Trilogy, DC Universe, Rocket League, The Last of Us, and Planet Side 2. Back to Destiny, I like helping people out when I have the time. I'm max level on all 3 characters, as well as finishing all the raids countless times. I'm well experience in the game.
